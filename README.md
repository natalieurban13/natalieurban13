Hello, my name is Natalie Urban. 

I graduated from Western Governors University with a Bachelor's Degree in Data Management/Data Analytics in May of 2023. I am passionate about working with data to find solutions, answer business questions, and create machine learning models that will drive a company towards improvement. This portfolio mainly consists of my university projects that I have created over the past few years. 

If you have any questions or would like to contact me, please reach out via LinkedIn.
